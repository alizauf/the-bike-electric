# Is there an electric Citi Bike near you?

This is the project that powers the website: [https://i-want-to-ride-an-electric-citi.bike](https://i-want-to-ride-an-electric-citi.bike)

Citi Bike operates the bike share in NYC. They've recently introduced electric bikes (‚ö°Ô∏èüö≤!)  and they are elusive as heck. After a weekend of not being able to find one, I made this app.

Made by [Aliza Aufrichtig](https://www.twitter.com/alizauf).

## Want to run it locally?

Clone this repo, then run:

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

The app is written using [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and [Citi Bike's Real Time Data API](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). It is not affiliated with, approved by, endorsed by, or sponsored by Citi Bike. 

##I hope you find an ‚ö°Ô∏èüö≤!
